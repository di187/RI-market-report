Lipid refers to fat comprising proteins and carbohydrates. Cholesterol and triglycerides are lipids that are stored in the human body and serve as a source of energy. Dyslipidaemia is the imbalance in the lipid level in the bloodstream. It is characterized by high levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood. High cholesterol levels can cause cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as stroke and atherosclerosis. The typical range of total blood cholesterol is 140-200 mg/dL. Blood cholesterol contains individual components such as LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol to the body while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) removes cholesterol from the cells by reversing cholesterol transport to the liver. Due to their distinct roles, these components are individually assessed to determine the dyslipidemic status of an individual.
